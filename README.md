Disposable & Reneweable Respirator

This project is still under development. I post progress and files periodically, but the most recent work is on my local drive. Feel free to email me with questions at basicrespirator@gmail.com and/or I can add you to the mailing list for updates. 

December 1st updates include:
•  Updated flat patterns for all 5 NIOSH recommended sizes
•  Updated 3D printable mask in medium
•  Updated filter assembly

DISCLAIMER
This respirator design is not NIOSH certified or FDA approved. Please use your best judgement and discretion before wearing this mask and observe the guidelines recommended by the CDC and public health departments. We do not claim that this mask is guaranteed to keep you protected from COVID-19.

If you are a hospital or clinician interested in reviewing and/or testing this design, please email basicrespirator@gmail.com for an evaluation kit.
