Disposable Respirator

Print both STL files for the filter assembly at .20mm with no supports. Both items print in under an hour and do not require cleanup.

The flat pattern PDF contains instructions for assembling the mask

April 11th - I am currently working on v0.95 release which includes:
•  More detailed assembly instructions and videos
•  Small, Medium and Large sizes 
•  Lowered nose so the masks fits better under glasses and goggles
•  Neoprene gasket for filter opening
•  Larger filter size
•  Printed disclaimer

I hope to upload this within the next couple of days. If you are currently making this mask and having any trouble with the instructions, files or fit, please email me at basicrespirator@gmail.com I am happy to help explain things and it is great user feedback for me as well.
