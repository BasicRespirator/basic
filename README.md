Basic Respirator comes in 3 versions 

1: Reusable 3D printable</br>
2: Reusable cut & sew from water repellant ballistic nylon fabric with 3D printed filter assembly</br>
3: Disposable cut & fold from Tyvek 1073B with 3D printed filter assembly</br>

All versions accept a standard 3 1/8" N95 disc filter manufactured by Honeywell or Moldex. Neoprene is used for the seal against the face and to prevent leakage through the filter assembly. 

The cut & sew version is more complicated to make, but can be produced with a heavy duty home sewing machine. Tyvek can be printed on an inket printer and many double-sided adhesives are available. 

This is intended to be a surgical N95 respirator, but may not meet regulations. Some coated fabrics contain carcinogens that are dangerous to inhale. The design for the filter assembly will likely need to be modified to increase the surface area and slow airflow. I have released the design as-is and will continue modifications. 

DISCLAIMER
This design is a work in progress and not NIOSH certified or FDA approved. Please use your best judgement and discretion before wearing this mask and observe the guidelines recommended by the CDC and public health departments. We do not claim that this mask is guaranteed to keep you protected from COVID-19.
