Baisc Respirator comes in 3 versions 

1: Reusable 3D printable
2: Reusable cut & sew from water repellant nylon fabric with 3D printed filter assembly
3: Disposable cut & fold from Tyvek with 3D printed filter assembly

All versions accept a standard 3 1/8" N95 disc filter manufactured by Honeywell or Moldex. Neoprene gaskets are used for the seal against the face and to prevent leakage through the filter assembly. 

The cut & sew version is more complicated to make, but can be sewn on any home sewing machine.
